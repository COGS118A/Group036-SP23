    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Music platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music have been employing the use of recommender systems for a years now. Built on a series of algorithms, these platforms will maintain a massive database of songs and their attributes, and recommend certain music selections to individuals based on past music taste and popular streams. However, with these algorithms getting more advanced, song recommendations are getting very specialized based on clustering and clouds of similarity<a name=\"recsystem\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#recsystem). \n",
    "\n",
    "Song popularity is constantly changing and is usually based on all-time views but also number of shares, pre-saves, and recent popularity.<a name=\"popularity\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#popularity). When recommeding new music, platforms will try to recommend new music uploads to build a profile on individuals and spread releases to gain popularity. Yet, because of the recommender algorithm basing profiles on clustering techniques, and the fact that popularity of a song is measured by more factors than just all-time views, it's possible that the songs recommended as popular are in fact not the most popular songs<a name=\"popularity\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#popularity). \n",
    "\n",
    "A series of studies have been completed on the topic of music recommender systems and how they choose the popular songs that are recommended. One specific paper shows that in the United States, especially songs in languages other than english or from non-American artists are less likely to be recommended to individuals even if all other attributes of the song's metadata match up with the user's preferences<a name=\"survey\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#survey). This means that recommender systems for music need to be improved so that total views has a more balanced influence on music choices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having a good algorithm for predicting the view count of a song based on its other features allows recommender systems to more effectively suggest relevant songs. It can also help music artists and record labels better understand the features necessary in a song for it to be popular. "

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly describe the problem that you are solving. Avoid ambiguous words. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one ML-relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms), measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).\n",
    "\n",
    "(Saarthak)The problem at hand is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the range of the number of views/plays a song will receive based on various factors such as language, genre, lyrics and other relevant attributes. The goal is to leverage a database containing over 3 million songs and their corresponding play/view counts to build a robust predictive model. We can express it in mathematical terms by defining the target variable (number of views/plays) as a continuous numerical value. The model's prediction range can be quantified as a lower bound and an upper bound estimate. Since we have access to a vast database of songs with their historical view/play counts. We can train and evaluate the model using this data, observing the predicted ranges against the actual counts to determine its efficacy. Furthermore, the model's performance can be measured and compared across different subsets of the dataset or on new unseen songs to validate its generalizability. The model can be trained and evaluated multiple times using various subsets of the dataset or with different feature combinations to explore different hypotheses and improve its predictive capabilities."

Make sure to describe how the solution will be tested.  \n",

    "The proposed solution for this problem is to employ a supervised machine learning approach, specifically a regression model, to predict lower and upper bounds for song views based on given song features. The model will leverage the dataset of over 3 million songs, which includes features like genre, artist, language, title, lyrics, and year of release. \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to employ ensemble methods, particularly using deep learning, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for lyrics analysis. To handle combining the lyrics analysis with the rest of the features we propose to use Random Forest algorithms because of their potential to handle complex, non-linear relationships, and mitigate overfitting. The model will be implemented using the Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras libraries in Python. Scikit-learn will be used for pre-processing, feature selection, and training traditional machine learning models. TensorFlow and Keras will be used for the implementation of deep learning part. \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of the models will be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R2) score, which are common performance metrics for regression problems. We will perform k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance and its robustness across different subsets of the data. We think that this solution might work as it leverages the power of both traditional machine learning and deep learning capturing both linear and non-linear patterns in the data. Furthermore, the use of a large dataset increases the likelihood of the model generalizing well to unseen data. "

Hence, it's important to consider potential ethical issues and implications related to data privacy, as well as possible unintended consequences. If the model prioritizes songs predicted to have high view counts, it might stifle diversity and reinforce a popularity echo chamber. To address this, we could consider incorporating some measure of diversity or novelty into our model while addressing these consernses. One potential ethical concern is the possibility of bias in our model. For instance, if the training data is skewed towards certain genres, languages, or artists, our model may inadvertently favor those groups when predicting views. We'll carefully examine our dataset for such biases and consider techniques such as resampling or weighting to mitigate them. We will ensure transparency by documenting our methodology, acknowledging limitations, and being open to feedback. \n"
